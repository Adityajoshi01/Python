A map is a container that stores elements in a key-value format, 
where each key is unique and is used to access its corresponding value. 

A hash map is a specific implementation of a map, where the keys are hashed to provide efficient access to the corresponding values. 

The main difference between the two is that map is an abstract data type, while hash map is a concrete implementation of the map data type.
Hash map is more efficient in terms of time complexity for searching, insertion and deletion 
compared to map.
