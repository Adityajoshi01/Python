#Linked list:-1.It is a liner data structure that stores  collection of data element dynamically.
             #2.Node represent those data elements and pointers connect each node.
	     #3.Each node consists of two fields, info stroed in a linked list and pointer that stores address of its next node.
	     #4.Last node contains null in its second field vecause it will point to no node.
